Dependencies (Debian):

Download and install ZMQ 4.0+
Make sure Obelisk server has crypto disabled (gateway isn't using it yet).

Download latest pyzmq from: https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq/downloads

  $ tar xf pyzmq-2.2.0.1.tar.gz
  $ cd pyzmq-2.2.0.1/
  $ python setup.py build

You can install system wide as root, or alternatively set the PYTHONPATH
variable in your ~/.bashrc

  /path/to/pyzmq-2.2.0.1/build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.7

Make sure that path actually exists as it may differ slightly
from system to system.

Get python-obelisk and set your PYTHONPATH accordingly:

  https://github.com/darkwallet/python-obelisk

  # apt-get install python-pip python-twisted
  # pip install tornado pyelliptic ecdsa

  $ cd daemon/txrad/
  $ make

  $ export PYTHONPATH="/path-to-gateway-repo/lib:$PYTHONPATH"
